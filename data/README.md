# data folder

This folder contains data for VCG sites for use in the NorESM Land Sites Platform (LSP) or CLM in general for single-site simulations in the Vestland Climate Grid locations.

- Simple site names, e.g. ALP1.zip = land surface file modified, otherwise identical to the LSP input data
- added _cosmorea, e.g. ALP1_cosmorea = land surface file modified, AND datmdata replaced with COSMO reanalysis data subset by Hui Tang
- added _cosmorea_noleap = same as above, but with noleap version of forcing data.
- added _cosmorea_warmed = modified _cosmorea_noleap data where temperature was increased (see notebook in src)
